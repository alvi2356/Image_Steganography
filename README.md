# Image_Steganography
This research project, implemented in Java, allows a client to connect to a server for chat using image steganography. The server issues a one-time password (OTP) to the client upon connection for authentication. Following authorization, the client and server can chat, embedding messages within images through encoding. To access these hidden messages, the client selects an image, opens a decoder, and uses the provided OTP to extract the embedded content.
